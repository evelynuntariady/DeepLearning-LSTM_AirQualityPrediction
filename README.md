# DeepLearning-LSTM_AirQualityPrediction
This project develops a deep learning model using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to predict air quality levels based on historical environmental data. The model leverages the ability of LSTMs to capture temporal dependencies in time series data, enabling more accurate forecasts of air pollution trends.

Features :
1. Data Preprocessing
   
a. Handled missing values, normalized features, and prepared time series sequences

b. Converted raw air quality data into supervised learning format for LSTM input


2. Model Architecture

a. Implemented an LSTM neural network for time series prediction

b. Tuned hyperparameters such as sequence length, batch size, and number of layers


3. Training & Evaluation

a. Trained on historical air quality measurements

b. Evaluated performance using metrics such as R2, RMSE and MAE

c. Visualized predicted vs actual air quality trends
